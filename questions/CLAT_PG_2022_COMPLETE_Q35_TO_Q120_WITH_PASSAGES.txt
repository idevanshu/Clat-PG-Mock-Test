PASSAGE I: PHILOSOPHY OF LAW

Both lawmen and laymen often ask, 'What is the law applicable to a given set of facts?' The answers to this question differ depending upon the specific jurisdiction to which the given set of facts is linked. Contrary to this, scholars and students of jurisprudence are likely to ask the general question, viz 'What is Law?'. This question on the philosophy and nature of law supposes that law is a distinctive social-political phenomenon with universal characteristics that can be perceived through philosophical analysis. In such a study, the assumption is that law possesses some universal characteristics.

An analysis of the philosophy of law can be done for different reasons. Apart from a purely intellectual interest in understanding this complex phenomenon known as law, scholars also study the same as a normative social practice that purports to guide human behaviour, giving rise to reasons for action. The primary challenge of the branch of scholarship known as jurisprudence is based on this 'normative, reason-giving aspect of law'. At the same time, we must understand that law is not the only normative realm in any given society. It is one of the many normative standards such as morality, religion, customs and usages, etiquette, self-regulatory standards within a family or corporation etc. So, it is also essential that we study law on the differences and similarities of the same with these normative standards.

While discerning these connections and contradictions, legal theories often study the content of the norm apart from giving importance to the source. Generally, theoretical studies on the content such as natural lawyers emphasize values such as fairness, justice, liberty etc., as qualifications for the norms to be called laws. They have argued that laws must be in tune with certain principles of inner morality, such as that laws be general, public, prospective, coherent, clear, stable, and practicable are indispensable to law-making. Whereas theories that give prominence to the sources of the norm, such as enactment/command by political institution/authority, do not always emphasize on the content.

Such philosophical analysis of law comprises both explanatory and justificatory aspects. While the explanatory aspect consists of explaining how laws can give rise to reasons and what kinds of reasons are involved. One example of this would be Dworkin's classification of law as concepts, principles and rules. The aspect of justification concerns whether people ought to comply with the law's demands. In other words, it is the attempt to explain the moral legitimacy of law and the subjects' reasons for complying with it.

QUESTION 3: 
"The falsehood of legal positivism resides in envisaging that the law consists of only rules. However, this is a serious mistake since legal principles partly determine the law in addition to rules.

PASSAGE II: MORALITY OF LAW BY LON L. FULLER

A thought-provoking book titled 'The Morality of Law' by Lon L. Fuller on moral philosophy insists on a distinction between 'morality of aspiration' and 'morality of duty'. From the view of the morality of aspiration, the human conduct does not bear on mandatory rules but on conceptions of the 'Good Life', of 'what beseems a human being functioning at his best to human capacities'. Because no law can compel a man to live up to the excellence of which he is capable. But for workable standards of judgment, the morality of duty lays down the basic rules without which an ordered society directed towards certain specific goals must fail of its mark. Because the duty ties it very closely to what is 'rationally discoverable' and 'objective', as contrasted with the morality of aspiration based on subjectivism.

However, moralists may differ as to what range of conduct should fall within the respective spheres of duty and the morality of aspirations. "When we are passing a judgment of moral duty, it seems absurd to say that such a duty can in some way flow directly from knowledge of a situation of fact." As due to the fact that before we conclude 'that a duty ought to exist', however well we may understand the facts, by the close connection between understanding a person's ideals, approval and disapproval. Does this mean that duties are rationally discoverable, and a matter of choice, even if not of 'ineffable preference'? Presumably not, since when we pass a moral judgment of duty 'ought' to exist. It is necessary to distinguish between the accepted morality of a social group and the personal morality of individuals. 'Duty' may appear in all of these, but the satisfaction is very often a matter of degree varying from situation to situation.

The rule of a morality of duty is necessary for social living. The morality of aspiration provides a general idea of the perfection we ought to acquire it. If we consider the whole range of moral issues, we may imagine a yardstick which begins at the bottom with the most obvious demands of social living and extends upward to the highest reaches of human aspirations. Somewhere along this scale an invisible pointer marks the dividing line where the pressure of duty leaves off and the challenge of excellence begins. The whole field of moral argument is an undeclared war over the location of this pointer. Whom we regard as being moralistic are always trying to inch the pointer upward so as to expand the area of duty and they bludgeon us into a belief that we are duty bound to embrace this pattern of human conduct, instead of making us realize a pattern of life they consider worthy of human nature.

Which of the following statements regarding the 'morality of aspiration' is untrue?
(A) The morality of aspiration is based on inevitable rules for ordered social living.

PASSAGE III: JUDICIAL APPOINTMENTS AND COLLEGIUM SYSTEM

The present system of appointments as envisaged by the Constitution and as elucidated in the Collegium system makes it clear that the first step is a recommendation from Collegium of four senior-most judges and presided over by the Chief Justice. This process in turn requires wide consultation by the Chief Justice of the High Court to identify the requisite talent, so as to make the recommendations. Contrary to some portrayed beliefs as if this is an extremely subjective system, every Chief Justice is actually required to solicit names from different sources whether it be sitting judges, retired judges, or prominent members of the Bar. It is from this pool of talent that he selects, after a discussion in the collegium, the most suitable candidates. It is thus of utmost importance that the flow of recommendations continues for the appointment process to work successfully.

The current situation of vacancies, especially in some of the larger courts with very few recommendations in the pipeline seems to be the genesis of this problem. The data placed before us, as drawn from the National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG) shows that five (5) High Courts alone are responsible for 54% of the pendency of over 57,51,312 cases i.e., the High Courts of Allahabad, Punjab & Haryana, Madras, Bombay, and Rajasthan. The Madras High Court has among the highest arrears in the country of 5.8 lakh cases despite having fewer vacancies than most other High Courts (i.e., 7%). This does not take away from the requirement of appointing ad hoc Judges but supports the view that even if the existing vacancies are few, a situation may arise requiring the expertise of experienced Judges to be appointed as ad hoc Judges.

PASSAGE IV: RIGHT TO PEACEFUL PROTEST

The Supreme Court of India observed that, while appreciating the existence of the right to peaceful protest against a legislation we have to make it unequivocally clear that public ways and public spaces cannot be occupied in such a manner and that too indefinitely. Democracy and dissent go hand in hand, but then the demonstrations expressing dissent must be in designated places alone. The present case was not even one of protests taking place in an undesignated area but was a blockage of a public way which caused grave inconvenience to commuters. We cannot accept the plea of the applicants that an indeterminable number of people can assemble whenever they choose to protest.

PASSAGE V: MAINTENANCE LAWS

The Supreme Court of India has held that the rationale of granting maintenance from the date of application finds its roots in the object of enacting maintenance legislations, so as to enable the wife to overcome the financial crunch which occurs on separation from the husband. Financial constraints of a dependant spouse hamper their capacity to be effectively represented before the Court. Enforcement of the order of maintenance is the most challenging issue, which is encountered by the applicants. If maintenance is not paid in a timely manner, it defeats the very object of the social welfare legislation. Execution petitions usually remain pending for months, if not years, which completely nullifies the object of the law.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

QUESTION 25: 
Based on the given excerpt from the judgment, which of the following judgments is related to enforcement of orders of maintenance?

PASSAGE VI: FAMILY COURTS

The Supreme Court of India has held that the nature of inquiry before the Family Court is, indeed, adjudicatory. It is obliged to resolve the rival claims of the parties and while doing so, it must adhere to the norms prescribed by the statute in that regard and also the foundational principle of fairness of procedure and natural justice. These provisions plainly reveal that the Family Court is expected to follow procedure known to law, which means insist for a formal pleading to be filed by both sides, then frame the issues for determination, record the evidence of the parties to prove the facts asserted by the concerned party and only thereafter, to enter upon determination and render decision thereon by recording the reasons for such decision. For doing this, the Family Court is expected to give notice to the respective parties and provide them sufficient time and opportunity to present their claim in the form of pleadings and evidence before determination of the dispute.

PASSAGE VII: FRUSTRATION OF CONTRACT AND IMPOSSIBILITY OF PERFORMANCE

The Supreme Court of India, in South East Asia Marine Engineering & Constructions Ltd. (SEAMEC LTD.) v. Oil India Ltd., (2020) 5 SCC 164, noted that, under the Indian contract law, the consequences of a force majeure event are provided for under Section 56 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 which deals with a contract to do an Act which, after the contract is made, becomes impossible, or, by reason of some event which the promisor could not prevent, unlawful, becomes void when the Act becomes impossible or unlawful. When the parties have not provided for what would take place when an event which renders the performance of the contract impossible, then Section 56 applies. When the Act contracted for becomes impossible, then under Section 56, the parties are exempted from further performance and the contract becomes void. The Court has further held that in Section 56, the word 'impossible' is to be taken in its practical and not literal sense.

In deciding cases in India, the only doctrine that we have to go by is that of supervening impossibility or illegality as laid down in Section 56 of the Contract Act 1872, taking the word 'impossible' in its practical and not literal sense. The Doctrine of Frustration will not be applicable to assist a party that does not want to fulfil its obligations under the contract. The law has always held that the performance of the act may not be literally impossible, but it may be impracticable from the point of view of the object and the parties must be aware about this impracticability because they could have been aware at the time of formation of contract.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Article 254 of the Constitution of India deals with the case where there is a conflict between the Union law and State law on a subject under the Concurrent List. The article provides a twin requirement test to determine repugnancy: (1) repugnancy between the Central Act and State Act within the Concurrent List; and (2) State Act has been reserved for the consideration of the President and has received the assent of the President.

The word 'assent' used in Article 254(2) means an express agreement of mind to what is proposed by the State Legislature by enacting a new law on the same subject on which the Central law already exists. It is a constitutional formality of obtaining consent of the President for promulgating a new Act. When a State legislature enacts an Act on a subject vested to it by the Constitution, if incidentally the provisions of such a State Act operate on a subject which is exclusively vested to Parliament, such incidental coverage must be determined by the test of 'pith and substance'. The test of 'pith and substance' is used to determine if the real character and effect of the State Act lie within State competence.

PASSAGE X: DOWRY DEATH AND BRIDE BURNING

The Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 defines dowry as any property or valuable security given or agreed to be given either directly or indirectly by one party to a marriage, by or on behalf of the bride or her relations to the bridegroom or his relations. Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 provides a definition of cruelty by the husband or his relatives, and Section 304-B addresses dowry death. The term 'soon before' in Section 304-B is not to be strictly interpreted as 'immediately before'. The Supreme Court has held that whether the demand for dowry was 'soon before' the death of the victim must be determined on the basis of the totality of circumstances of each case, without relying on any straight jacket formula. The gravity of demand of dowry, including the existence of burns or injuries inflicted while making such demand, is a relevant consideration.

In order to establish an offence under Section 304-B of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, the prosecution must prove that the death of the victim occurred 'otherwise than under normal circumstances' which may be homicidal, suicidal or accidental. The Supreme Court has observed that the legislative intent of Section 304-B is to curb the social evil of bride burning and dowry demand. The presumption as to dowry death provided under Section 113B of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 is a 'shall' presumption, which is mandatory in nature.

PASSAGE XI: INTERNATIONAL MARITIME LAW AND TERRITORIAL WATERS

A Coastal State has sovereignty over its territorial waters, the seabed and subsoil underlying such waters, and the air space above them, subject to the obligations imposed by International Law. This sovereignty is not 'given', but it is only asserted by the State.

Article 89 of UNCLOS makes an express declaration that 'No State may validly purport to subject any part of the high seas to its sovereignty.' According to Article 94(7) of UNCLOS, in the event of a marine casualty or incident of navigation on the high seas involving a ship flying a State's flag and causing loss of life or serious injury to nationals of another State, the duty of the Flag State is to cause an inquiry to be held by or before suitably qualified person(s) into such casualty or incident.

PASSAGE XII: CONTINGENT CONTRACTS

A contingent contract is a contract to do or not to do something, if some event, collateral to such contract, happens or does not happen. For example, 'A' agrees to pay 'B' a sum of money if a certain cruise does not return. In such a contract, no contract comes into existence until the contingency occurs. The parties are under no obligation till the happening of that event unless there is a term requiring the parties to make effort to make that event happen. A contract contingent upon the happening of an event can be enforced after that event occurs. If the event becomes impossible, the contract becomes void.

The difference between wagering agreements and contingent contracts is that wagering agreements are void and contingent contracts are valid. One party cannot assume an immediate unilateral obligation subject to a condition because the essence of a contract requires a meeting of minds. In case of contingent contracts, the parties cannot enter into an immediately binding contract; rather the operation of the contract is made to depend upon the happening of the specified event. 'A' agrees to pay 'Z' an amount of 2 lakhs if 'Z' marries 'B'. 'B' was dead at the time of the said agreement between 'A' and 'Z'. In this case, the agreement is void because the event was impossible in its nature.

PASSAGE XIII: AMALGAMATION AND INCOME TAX TREATMENT

Amalgamation is the merger of one or more companies with another company. Alternatively, amalgamation may be the merger of two or more companies to form a new company. The amalgamating company integrates with the amalgamated company and the former is dissolved without winding up. On amalgamation of a company, succession of capital assets of the amalgamating company by the amalgamated company does not result in transfer as defined in Section 47 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, and hence no capital gain arises. The amalgamated company can set off the losses of the amalgamating company if conditions of the Income Tax Act, 1961 are complied with. The accumulated loss of the amalgamating company shall be deemed to be the loss of the amalgamated company for the previous year in which the amalgamation was effected. On amalgamation, the business of the transferor company does not cease but is deemed to continue, and under various provisions of the Income Tax Act, the transferee is deemed to carry on the enterprise as that of the transferor.

PASSAGE XIV: PUBLIC HEALTH POLICY AND JUDICIAL REVIEW

Policy-making is a normal executive function. However, the power of judicial review may be exercised on public health policies. The separation of powers principle restricts the power of judicial review on matters of policy, but not entirely. Soliciting constitutional justification for executive policies in managing a public health crisis during a pandemic appears to be a necessary function of the court. The Union of India opposed judicial intervention in apprehension of circumstances restricting the scope for the executive to explore solutions. The said argument was supported on the ground that judges are not public health experts, and the executive needs room for free play while dealing with a pandemic. However, constitutional rights cannot be suspended during a pandemic. An intrusion by the judiciary in the domain of the executive is prohibited under the separation of powers principle, except when it is necessary to do so in order to enforce the express provisions of the Constitution or to safeguard the rights relating to life, liberty or property as secured to the individual by the Constitution.

In the case of In Re: Distribution of Essential Supplies and Services During Pandemic, the Supreme Court examined the constitutional validity of the Central Government's policy regarding vaccine procurement and distribution among different categories of the population, known as the Liberalized Vaccination Policy. Public health is a subject under Entry 6 of List II (State List) of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution.

These principles are part of environmental jurisprudence in India. Water is the basic need for the survival of human beings and is part of right of life and human rights as enshrined in Article 21 of the Constitution of India, as held in Narmada Bachao Andolan v. Union of India.

PASSAGE XVI: CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE AND BURDEN OF PROOF

When a person does an act with some intention other than that which the character and circumstances of the act suggest, the burden of proving that intention is upon that person who conceives such intention. In a criminal case, where there is conflict between the presumption of innocence and any other presumption, the presumption of innocence shall prevail. Where the evidence is of a circumstantial nature, the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should be fully established. An admissibility of circumstantial evidence against the accused requires a chain of evidence which does not leave any reasonable ground for a conclusion consistent with the innocence of the accused and must be such as to show that within all human probability the act must have been done by the accused. When a murder charge is to be proved solely on circumstantial evidence, the presumption of innocence of the accused must have a dominant role.

PASSAGE XIX: UNJUST ENRICHMENT AND TAXATION

Doctrine of Unjust Enrichment implies obtaining benefit from another (which is not a gift) without legal justification and restoration of the benefits obtained without legal justification. This doctrine is applicable to both contractual and tax matters. A business entity can claim refund of tax on the ground of unjust enrichment when the tax has been levied without the authority of law and the burden of tax is borne by the business entity. Tax can be declared as unconstitutional if the tax has been levied without the authority of law or if the legislature does not have legislative competence to levy that tax.

In Union of India v. Mohit Minerals Pvt. Ltd. (2019) 2 SCC 599, the challenge to constitutionality of the Goods and Service Tax (Compensation to States) Act, 2017 on the ground of lack of legislative competence was rejected. Additional tax, in the form of tax on tax, for a specified purpose is called Cess. The doctrine ensures that no one unjustly enriches themselves at the expense of another and that benefits obtained unlawfully must be restored.
